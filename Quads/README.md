# ðŸ§© Quads Project (Go)

This project is part of my **Piscine Go journey** at [01Talent x Nextera], focused on learning loops, conditionals, and ASCII-based pattern generation using Go.

---

## ðŸ§  Overview
Each function (`QuadA` to `QuadE`) prints a unique rectangle pattern based on width (`x`) and height (`y`).

If either `x` or `y` are not positive, the program prints nothing.
